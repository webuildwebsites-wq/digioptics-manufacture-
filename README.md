# Lens Manufacturing & Order Management ERP System

A comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system designed specifically for lens manufacturing companies with **simplified 2-schema authentication** - one for platform users (SuperAdmin, SubAdmin, Supervisors, Users) and one for customers (retailers/end customers).

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Simplified Authentication Structure
```
User Schema (All Platform Users)
├── SuperAdmin (Global access)
├── SubAdmin (Multi-department access)
├── Supervisor (Department + Region specific)
└── User (Role-based department access)

Customer Schema (External Users)
└── Customers (Retailers, Distributors, End Customers)
```

### Hierarchical Structure
```
Super Admin (Single User)
├── Sub Admin (Multiple)
    ├── Department: Lab
    │   ├── Region: North → Supervisor → Users
    │   ├── Region: South → Supervisor → Users
    │   ├── Region: East → Supervisor → Users
    │   └── Region: West → Supervisor → Users
    ├── Department: Store
    ├── Department: Dispatch
    ├── Department: Sales
    ├── Department: Finance
    └── Department: Customer Support
```

### Lab Production Workflow (Sequential & Mandatory)
```
Order → Job Card Print → Pick Ticket → Assign Tray → Production → 
Surfacing → Tint → Hardcoat → ARC → Quality Check → Fitting → 
Final QC → Dispatch
```

### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /users` - Get all users (with pagination and filters)
- `POST /users` - Create new user
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user by ID
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Deactivate user

- `GET /orders` - Get all orders (with filters)
- `POST /orders` - Create new order
- `GET /orders/:id` - Get order details
- `PUT /orders/:id` - Update order

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Simplified 2-Schema Authentication
- **User Schema**: All platform users (SuperAdmin, SubAdmin, Supervisors, Users) with hierarchical permissions
- **Customer Schema**: External customers (Retailers, Distributors) with business information and credit management

### Core Collections
- **User**: Platform users with role-based hierarchy and permissions
- **Customer**: External customers with business details and verification status
- **Order**: Customer orders with complete lifecycle tracking
- **OrderWorkflow**: Production workflow step-by-step tracking
- **Product**: Lens products and specifications
- **Supplier**: Product suppliers and vendor management

## 🔐 Role-Permission Matrix

| Permission | Super Admin | Sub Admin | Supervisor | User |
|------------|-------------|-----------|------------|------|
| User Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ❌ |
| Order Management | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ✅* |
| Workflow Processing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅* | ✅* |
| Financial Management | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| System Settings | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

*✅ = Full Access, ❌ = No Access, ✅* = Restricted Access (department/region specific)*

## 🔄 Workflow Logic

### Order Creation Flow
1. **Order Validation**: Customer verification, credit check, product availability
2. **Lab Assignment**: Automatic assignment based on customer mapping and capacity
3. **Production Queue**: Order enters sequential workflow

### Production Workflow Rules
- **Sequential Processing**: No step can be skipped
- **Quality Control**: Each step has configurable quality parameters
- **Rework Logic**: Failed steps return to previous step
- **Rejection Logic**: Rejected items return to store for new base

### Status Management
- **Order Status**: Pending → In Production → Completed → Dispatched → Delivered
- **Sub Status**: Tracks current workflow step
- **Priority Levels**: Normal, High, Urgent (affects delivery timelines)

## 📊 Reporting & Analytics

### Dashboard Metrics
- Total orders and revenue
- Department-wise performance
- Quality control statistics
- Delivery performance
- Customer satisfaction metrics

### Available Reports
- Order reports (by date, status, customer)
- Production reports (efficiency, quality)
- Financial reports (revenue, outstanding)
- Customer reports (activity, credit status)
